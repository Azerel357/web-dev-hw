    <h1> How to create a D&D Character for beginners</h1>
    <p>
      First off,when creating your character, you'll need to acquire a Player's
      Handbook (cover image below). These can be found at a Barnes and Noble
      or mostly any book store. Next, you'll have to get a character sheet (image below).
      These can be printed off of the internet for free. You will aslo need a dice set
      consisting of (at least one of each) a 4 sided die, a 6 die, an 8 sided die, a
      10 (ranging 0-9) sided die, a 12 sided die, a 20 sided die, and another 10
      sided die (ranging from 00-90). Now to finally start making the character.
      <ol>
        <li>Figure out what race you would like to be. The races and their
        respective racce boons can be found in pages 17-42</li>
        <br><li>Look through the class sections and pick out what class you'd like.
        This is one of the most immprtant decision of making your charater,
        as it will determine what teh charater is good at and how they act in combat.
        The classes can be found in pages 45-112</li>
        <br><li>Now you need to choose a background and an alignment. Your background
        determines your characters background (shocking revalation I know). It also
        determines what the characters starting equipment will be. The alignment of the
        character will determine how good/evil the character is and how you want to
        play them. These can be found on pages 121-125</li>
        <br><li>When going through your class, there will a section called
        "Equipment" in which it will state what kind of equipment your character will be stating
        with. Thet will most often then not give you an options on what you would like to start out with.
        For example, the "Equipment" section in the "Rogue" class (pg. 96) gives you a option
        to either start with a rapier or a short sword. You will need to cross-reference
        between your class section and the equipment pages in order to figure out
        Waht you would like to start out with. The equipment pages are 143-159, however
        the only ones you need to start off at are pages 143-148</li>
        <br><li>Depending on your class, you will have the option to use magic. Magic is key in
        Dungeons and Dragons. You can find the spells that your character can use on pages 207-211</li>
        <br><li>One of the last things you'll need to do if roll for your abilities. There
        are 6 abilites that are crucial to the character: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
        Intelegence, Wisdom, and Charisma. How these are determined is by rolliing four
        6 sided die. Each time, remove the lowest number so you are left with three
        (Example: you roll a 5 2 3 4 you would remove the lowest number so you have a 5 3 4). Add those three numbers up, and
        make sure you write the totals down. Repeat this process until you have six total numbers.
        Higher numbers are better than lower numbers. Look at your characters class section0
        and arrange each number to an ablility that complements the class (Example:
        a Rogue would want a higher dexterity so they can sneak around, while a barbarian
        would want a higher strength so they can smash things). Then, look at your race page
        and add your race bonus to the numbers (Example: A human gets a +1 to all abilities.
       So if you have 15 17 10 15 13 14 as your ablilites, the +1 would then turn that into
       16 18 11 16 14 15). This can be further explained on page 173 and 175</li>
       <br><li><b>OPTIONAL:</b>I always like to type out a table of what new skills will get when
       they level up. An example can be seen below. You will need to cross reference between
       your race and class sections in order to make a sheet like the example (the one below is
       a sheet of a human rogue)</li>
