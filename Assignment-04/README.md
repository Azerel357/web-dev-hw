1. I went to the year of my birth, 1997. In the pictures, there was a lot of focus
on space and spaceships. There were also a lot of pictures of Military personnel.
I think that America is still very military oriented, but I think the hype about
space has dramatically lessened.

2. The Git Hub Application was very confusing to me. When I went into it, it defaulted the text editor to Visual Studio Code and I have been working in Atom the entire time. The application wouldn't let me change it to Atom, which made me a little upset. I honestly don't know how to change that, and probably won't be using the application. I prefer working with the website version of GitHub anyway.
