1. One set of forms I usually see are the comment section in Youtube videos. The serve the purpose of letting the audience comment whatever they want (even if it doesn't have to do with the video).
2. Some examples might be a contact page on business websites (as they have a comment section to type in what need be and a submit button), the turn in page in moodle for assignments (to upload assignments from a computer to moodle), and search engines (a person can type in a term they want to search and press the "search" button)
3. I hate tables and forms. I always have, not just in coding either. I hate filling out forms and I absolutely hated tables in math. writing code for them does little, if anything, to quell that hate. I also didn't know what to use as an action for my input so I just wrote a comment saying "nothing here" and so the page just refreshes after the submit button is pressed. Also, I'm not sure the images part of the assignment and the "submit button of my choice" thing. If that isn't correct, could you please let me know how I could do better next time in order to get a better grade? Thank you :)
