1. I would say that Universal selector types would be something that selects everything. Element types select a certain element such as h1 elements. Class types are more specific like the "square" tag, they can effect a number of elements. ID types can be added inside a class type so thy can distinguish certain things in the class.
2. Palette I chose is pretty basic. The 1950's used a lot of pastel colors so that's why I used the pink background. I thought the blue wording went well with the pink. The white background color for the text just matched the text color better than any of the other colors.
3. CSS doesn't really compute with me. It was confusing and somewhat frustrating to make a good website. I couldn't figure out all of the mechanics and it was just pretty frustrating.
