    <h1>Anthony Stroppel</h1>
    <p>This is my fist website that I have made in my Intro to Web Design course.
      However, this is not my first website in general. I have made a few more html sites
      similar to this in previous course. This is different though, as this time around
      as I had some help on where to start. Coding has alwasys been difficult for me so
      when I would write code (in previous courses) and the instructor basiclly said,
      "Figure it out," I didn't really know what to do. With the help of the walkthrough
      and the software that I'm using, making this webpage is a lot easier!</p>
