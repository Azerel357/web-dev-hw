1. Almost everything was new and old in some way. In previous classes, I learned about head, title, and body tags, but I always got mixed up on how they were used. A lot of things were new to me and some others I learned in previous classes but ended up forgetting or being confused on how precisely they worked. Over all, I'd say this was a good experience.
2. CSS confuses the hell out of me. I used it once for another coding class I am taking, but what ever I tried, nothing worked and confused me. Since this class has made html more sense to me, I'm hoping that it can do the same for CSS.
3. The work cycle for this assignment was kind of hard, as I didn't really know what to talk about. But I looked over and saw my D&D stuff, I thought what could it hurt on doing it on that. I know that what I said in the website might not make much sense, but it will of you follow the steps (but sorry for not making sense).
