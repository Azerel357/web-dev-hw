    <h1>How to make Cinnimon Pull-aparts</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients (makes two batches)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 package of Rhodes frozen dinner rolls</li>
        <li>3 sticks of butter</li>
        <li>4 <i>tablespoons</i> of milk</li>
        <li>4 <i>tablespoons</i> of light Karo Syrup</li>
        <li>3 <i>cups</i> of brown sugar</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 Bundt pans</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Thaw the frozen Rhodes dinner rolls on a cookie sheet, when 1/3 thawed,
          <br>cut each circle of dough into 4 pieces with scissors. Let sit on cookie sheet
          <br>until thawed and a little raised. Sprinkle with cinnamon.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make caramel sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan then add the other ingredients,
          <br>sprinkle with cinnamon to your liking. Bring sauce to medium boil on medium
          <br>high heat stirring intermittently x 2 min (not roaring boil). The sauce
          <br> will look like a caramel color. Then remove from heat. Donâ€™t let it get
          <br>thick in the saucepan or it will be hard to drop into the Bundt pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spray Bundt pan with non-stick spray. Use a ladle to spoon 1 layer of sauce
          <br>in the bottom of the pan, followed by 1 layer of the cut dinner rolls.
          <br>Cover that layer with caramel sauce followed by another layer of dough,
          <br>repeat until you get 3-4 layers, use the last of the caramel sauce on top
          <br>of the rolls. Let sit and rise to 2/3 to 3/4 of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake at 350<sub>F.</sub> for 40 min. Let the pan sit for about 5 minutes then
          <br>dump the Bundt pan upside down on a plater or round cake storage container.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy! Heat rolls up in the microwave if eating after the rolls cool to
          <br>soften the dough and caramel sauce if needed.
        </li>
      </ol>
