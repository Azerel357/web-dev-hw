this repository is for web design homework

Hi all, name's Anthony. I'm currently a 4th year student at the University of Montana and am studying Digital Art. I majored in it last year so I have at least two more years to go before I get the degree. I like climbing trees, watching anime, playing games, hanging out with my girlfriend, and meeting new people. I am excited for this course.
