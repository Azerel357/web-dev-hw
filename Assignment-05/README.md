1. HTML formats only have one <body> and one <head> tags. The <head> makes up the
  meta elements while the <body> makes up the contents of the document.
2. Structural tags help structure the contents. For example, whether or not a
    piece of the <body> should be indented or in a list. Sematic tags are for
    specifically words/letters in the body. For example, the <i> tag is going to
    make a word/phrase/letter/etc. italicized and the <b> tag is boing to make a
    word/phrase/letter/etc. bold, but they don't organize the contents of the <body>
    like Structural tags do.
3. I had to wait to do this assignment. When I read that we were going to do a recipe,
    I wanted to do it on something that I remember from my childhood. My first thought
    went to brownies, but I remembered that my mom and grandma would always make
    me, my brother, and my cousins cinnamon pull-aparts for holidays. We ate them so
    rarely that they were almost like a delicacy. However, I needed a picture and
    so when I went to my parents house to do laundry, I convinced my mom to make some
    for the assignment.

P.S. Thanks you for making coding fun. Whenever I took coding courses in the past,
I dreaded doing Homework. But with your walkthroughs and Atom being the best text
editor that I've ever used, this Web Design course is one of my favorites this semester.
Thanks!
